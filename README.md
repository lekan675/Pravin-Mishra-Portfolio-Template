## Mandatory Ownership Proof (DMI Rule)
Before you deploy, you MUST edit the footer and add your details:

Original:

```html
<p>Crafted with <span>cloud</span> excellence by Pravin Mishra</p>
```

Add this line (example):

```html
<p><strong>Deployed by:</strong> DMI Cohort 2 | Olalekan Fashola | Group 6 | Week 4 | 07-02-2026</p>

<h2> Requirement </h2>

This task is to dynamically generate the date in the footer of the index.html file

<h2> How date is generated </h2>
 
 Date is now generated dynamically.

<h2> A small code snippet (footer section + JS if used) </h2>

I added "<span id="deployDate"></span>" in footer where date was

<script>

    const dateElement = document.getElementById('deployDate');
    const now = new Date();
    const options = { day: '2-digit', month: 'short', year: 'numeric' };
    const formattedDate = now.toLocaleDateString('en-GB', options);
    dateElement.textContent = formattedDate;

</script>


✅ This proof must be visible in your browser screenshot submission.
